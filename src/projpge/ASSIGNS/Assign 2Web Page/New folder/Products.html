    <h3 id="Star Delta">Star Delta</h3>
    <p>A star delta starter is a type of reduced voltage starter. We use it to reduce the starting current of the motor
        without using any external device or apparatus. This is a big advantage of a star delta starter, as it typically
        has around 1/3 of the inrush current compared to a DOL starter. <br>The starter mainly consists of a TPDP switch
        which stands for Tripple Pole Double Throw switch. This switch changes stator winding from star to delta. During
        starting condition stator winding is connected in the form of a star. Now we shall see how a star delta starter
        reduces the starting current of a three-phase induction motor.

        For that let us consider,

        VL = Supply Line Voltage, ILS = Supply Line Current and, IPS = Winding Current per Phase and Z = Impedance per
        phase winding at stand still condition. <br>
        As the winding is star connected, the winding current per phase (IPS) equals to supply line current (ILS).



        As the winding is star connected, the voltage across each phase of the winding is



        Hence, the winding current per phase is



        Since here, the winding current per phase (IPS) equals to the supply line current (ILS), we can write,



        Now, let us consider the situation where the motor gets started with delta connected stator winding from same
        three phase supply points,

        Star Delta Starter Control DiagramHere, ILD = Supply Line Current and, IPD = Winding Current per Phase and Z =
        Impedance per phase winding at stand still condition.

        As the winding is delta connected, supply line current (ILD) is root three times of the winding current per
        phase (IPD)



        As the winding is delta connected, the voltage across each phase of the winding is



        Hence, the winding current per phase is



        Now, we can write,



        Now, by comparing supply line currents drawn by an induction motor with star and delta connected winding, we get



        Thus we can say that the starting current from the mains in case of star delta is one-third of direct switching
        in the delta. Again, we know that the starting torque of an induction motor is proportional to the square of the
        voltage applied to the winding per phase.



        The equation shows that star delta starter reduces the starting torque to one-third of that produced by DOL
        starter. The star-delta starter is equivalent to an autotransformer with a 57.7% tapping.

        Advantages of Star Delta Starter
        The advantages of star delta starters include:

        Inexpensive
        No heat is produced, or tap changing device needs to be used, hence efficiency increases.
        Starting current reduced to 1/3 of direct online starting current.
        Produce high torque per ampere of line current.
        Disadvantages of Star Delta Starter
        The disadvantages of star delta starters include:

        Starting torque is reduced to 1/3 of full load torque.

    <h3 id="Power Factor">Power Factor</h3>
    <p>Power factor is an expression of energy efficiency. It is usually expressed as a percentageâ€”and the lower the
        percentage, the less efficient power usage is.

        Power factor (PF) is the ratio of working power, measured in kilowatts (kW), to apparent power, measured in
        kilovolt amperes (kVA). Apparent power, also known as demand, is the measure of the amount of power used to run
        machinery and equipment during a certain period. It is found by multiplying (kVA = V x A). The result is
        expressed as kVA units. <br>PF expresses the ratio of true power used in a circuit to the apparent power
        delivered to the circuit. A 96% power factor demonstrates more efficiency than a 75% power factor. PF below 95%
        is considered inefficient in many regions. <br>To calculate power factor, you need a power quality analyzer or
        power analyzer that measures both working power (kW) and apparent power (kVA), and to calculate the ratio of
        kW/kVA.

        The power factor formula can be expressed in other ways:

        PF = (True power)/(Apparent power)

        OR

        PF = W/VA

        Where watts measure useful power while VA measures supplied power. The ratio of the two is essentially useful
        power to supplied power, or
